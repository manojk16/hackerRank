/*
Objective:
Today's challenge puts your understanding of nested conditional statements to the test.
You already have the knowledge to complete this challenge, but check out the Tutorial tab for a video on testing!

Task:
Your local library needs your help! Given the expected and actual return dates for a library book, create a program
that calculates the fine (if any). The fee structure is as follows:

1. If the book is returned on or before the expected return date, no fine will be charged (i.e.: fine = 0)
2. If the book is returned after the expected return day but still within the same calendar month and year
   as the expected return date, fine = 15 hackos x the number of days late.
3. If the book is returned after the expected return month but still within the same calendar year as the
   expected return date, the fine = 500 hackos x the number of months late.
4. If the book is returned after the calendar year in which it was expected, there is a fixed fine of 10k Hackos.

Input Format

The first line contains 3 space-separated integers denoting the respective day, month, and year on which the book
was actually returned.
The second line contains 3 space-separated integers denoting the respective day, month, and year on which the book
was expected to be returned (due date).

Constraints
1 <= D <= 31
1 <= M <= 12
1 <= Y <= 3000

It is guaranteed the dates will be valid gregorian calendar dates.

Output Format

Print a single integer denoting the library fine for the book received as input.
